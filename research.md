# QSIB Manufacturing Research

### Overview

I spent one of my summers and an academic year working as a student researcher at the Querrey Simpson Institute for Bioelectronics, a Northwestern laboratory also known as the Roger's Lab. The lab specializes in compact, wearable bioelectronic devices built upon flexible PCBs created by Dr. John Rogers. My research was centered around automating the fabrication of such devices using a Pick and Place machine, which was a challenge due to both the small scale of the device components as well as the flexible nature of the PCBs.

### Research

My research was based on the fabrication of 2 different devices, a brain patch and an imaging device, both of which used an array of nanometer-scale diodes to influence the behavior of lab rats. Both were built upon flexible PCBs. While there were some significant technical differences between the two devices, for my purposes they were different variations of the same array, as both used similar LED components.

Previously, most devices in the lab using components this size were built by hand, using tweezers under a microscope -- an arduous and time-consuming process. My goal was to fully automate the component placement process, so that a fellow researcher could follow simple PCB mounting and solderpaste screen-printing instructions, place the device into the Pick and Place machine, calibrate, and press play.

As such, I compiled 3 main goals:

1. Find the best-performing method of picking up components, which would include testing various suction-tip sizes as well as machine settings.
2. Develop a proper PCB mounting procedure to ensure accurate component placement.
3. Provide instructions to fellow researchers so that my processes could be recreated.

### Methods



### Results

Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to include video of the lab or of the Pick and Place machine in action, but I will describe my results here.

Not using suction, using van-der-waals instead.

Providing instructions to properly clean end bit of pick and place machine, using smallest bit possible.

Proper PCB mounting guidance -- perfect accuracy and orientation extremely important.
