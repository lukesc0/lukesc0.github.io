# QSIB Manufacturing Research

### Overview

I spent one of my summers and an academic year working as a student researcher at the Querrey Simpson Institute for Bioelectronics, a Northwestern laboratory also known as the Roger's Lab. The lab specializes in compact, wearable bioelectronic devices built upon flexible PCBs created by Dr. John Rogers. My research was centered around automating the fabrication of such devices using a Pick and Place machine, which was a challenge due to both the small scale of the device components as well as the flexible nature of the PCBs.

### Research

My research was based on the fabrication of 2 different devices, a brain patch and an imaging device, both of which used nano-scale diodes to influence the behavior of lab rats.

### Results

Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to include video of the lab or of the Pick and Place machine in action.
