### Robot Thumb. 
_Robotics Capstone Project -- Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Lead_

A 6-month multi-team project to develop a robotic finger and thumb system controller by a haptic interface, allowing an operator to remotely grasp lab objects while providing tactile and force feedback. Designed and manufactured entirely in-house.
