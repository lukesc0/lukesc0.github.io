Hi! I'm Luke, a mechanical engineering student, and as I wrote in the brief description above this
is a website I made to act as an online portfolio to some of the most enjoyable projects that I've
worked on. I've also included a page where you can read more about me, such as my interests or work
history, and a contact page.

I plan to continuously update this website with new content. The projects page is not entirely
finished yet –– I plan to add more in the future, whenever I have time.

This website was made using Jekyll and Github Pages, using the Midnight theme. You can check out
the Github repo [here](https://](https://github.com/lukesc0/lukesc0.github.io)https://github.com/lukesc0/lukesc0.github.io).
