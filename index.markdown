### [Robot Thumb](./robot-thumb.html). 
_Robotics Capstone Project -- Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Lead_

A 6-month multi-team project to develop a robotic finger and thumb system controller by a haptic interface, allowing an operator to remotely grasp lab objects while providing tactile and force feedback. Designed and manufactured entirely in-house.

### [Line Following Robot](./line-follower.html). 
_Mechatronics Project -- Designer and Engineer_

A mechatronics competition in which I designed and built a wheeled line following robot, utilizing a PIC32 microntroller to issue motor commands and a Raspberry Pi PICO W running an image processing program through a camera.

### [Physics Simulations](./physics.html). 
_Dynamics Project -- Programmer_

A series of 2-dimensional physics simulations, coded by scratch in Python.

### [Pick and Place Machine Research](./research.html). 
_Querrey Simpson Institute for Bioelectronics -- Student Researcher_

As a student researcher at QSIB, a Northwestern biomedical and electronics lab, I specialized in optimizing the manufacturing of small-scale flexible electronics using a Pick and Place machine to mount SMD components.

### [Mounting Bracket](./bracket.html). 
_Mechanical Design Class -- Co-engineer_

A quarter-long mechanical design assignment in which I and a co-engineer developed a 3D printable milling machine mounting bracket.
