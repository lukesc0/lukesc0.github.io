### Robotic Thumb

#Overview

For my 6-month senior capstone project we were tasked with designing and manufacturing a robotic finger and thumb system that could be operated through a haptic controller. We were divided into 4 committees (mechanical, electrical, software, and integration) and 4 teams (robotic finger, robotic thumb, haptic finger, and haptic thumb). I was on the mechanical committee and the robot thumb team -- as such, my primary role was to lead the mechanical design and manufacturing of the thumb, as well as coordinate with mechanical engineers on other teams to ensure a cohesive and properly integrated overall system.
