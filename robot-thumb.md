# Robotic Thumb

### Overview

For my 6-month senior capstone project we were tasked with designing and manufacturing a robotic finger and thumb system that could be operated through a haptic controller. We were divided into 4 committees (mechanical, electrical, software, and integration) and 4 teams (robotic finger, robotic thumb, haptic finger, and haptic thumb). I was on the mechanical committee and the robot thumb team -- as such, my primary role was to lead the mechanical design and manufacturing of the thumb, as well as coordinate with mechanical engineers on other teams to ensure a cohesive and properly integrated overall system. This project will focus mainly on mechanical and manufacturing considerations.

### Design

Our final product had to meet the following design requirements:

1. Be capable of firmly grasping/manipulating light laboratory objects (ex: vials)
2. Provide real-time haptic feedback to the operator
3. A maximum of 2 actuators (both back-drivable) per robotic appendage
4. Must be designed almost entirely for in-house manufacturing and assembly out of metal

For req. 1, we settled on a target of 10-nm of torque applied at the tip of the thumb, based on quick calculations assuming the weight of a vial is ___.

We left the incorporation of req. 2 to the haptic thumb team.

Req. 3 was our most significant design constraint, as we wanted to achieve ___ DOF...

Req. 4 meant we had to design within the constraints of the manufacturing tools we had available. At our disposal was a waterjetting machine, milling machines, lathe machines, FDM 3D printers (to be used extremely minimally), as well as tools for general operations and assembly like bending or press fitting bearings. As a result of these constraints, our final product was made out of machined aluminum and assembled using smaller parts from McMaster-Carr -- more info in the manufacturing section below.

Motors...

After a prototyping phase in which we used 3D printers to demo various mechanical designs, the mechanical committee settled on a pulley driven "tendon" system, in which robotic links were driven by metal cables. After several iterations we settled upon a final design that utilized two main motions. Overview of system ____ backdrivability, slippage, tensioning mechanism, size
