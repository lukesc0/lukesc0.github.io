# About me

![Me](https://github.com/lukesc0/lukesc0.github.io/blob/main/IMG_9136.HEIC)

My name is Luke Carlson, and I'm from San Francisco, CA, where I graduated high school in 2016. Currently I
am an undergraduate student at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, with plans to graduate in June of 2024. 
I study Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in robotics and a minor in International Studies. I have a
wide variety of engineering-related interests, but as of now I am most enthusiastic about robotics and the
space industry. I also enjoy coding and making games in my free time, as well as learning about global history.

Outside of engineering, I also love to play music – I've been playing jazz drums for over ten years and rock
guitar for around five years. In the future I may update this website with some original recordings. My
other interests include skiing, casually playing basketball, and travelling – I hope to visit as many countries
and states as I possibly can in my lifetime.
