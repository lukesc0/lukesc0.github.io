# Physics Simulations

### Overview

This is a series of 2D mechanical dynamics simulations, coded and animated from scratch Python. Most are pendulum-based, but the final is a "jack-in-box" simulation. Click the links below to watch the demo videos, and scroll down to view a high-level overview of the code for the final simulation.
