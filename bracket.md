# 3D Printed Milling Machine Mounting Bracket

### Overview

This was a quarter long project during which I and another teammate co-engineered a milling machine bit mounting bracket. The idea was to create a bracket that could be 3D printed for rapid production and replacement, while still being capable of holding a milling machine bit undergoing standard machining operations.

### Design

Our final product had to meet the following design requirements:

1. With a milling machine bit mounted in the bracket and 100N of force applied at the end in either the x, y, or z directions, the end of the bit should deflect less than 2mm from its starting position in any direction.
2. 3D printable, made out of Nylon 12.
3. Less than 
4. Maintains a rectangular opening at the center of the bracket to house sensing equipment, such as an accelerometer for vibration testing.
